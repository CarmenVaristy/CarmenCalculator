Simple Calculator App: Overview, Design, and Development
The Simple Calculator App is designed to let users perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using a clean and user-friendly Android interface. Built using Kotlin in Android Studio, this app demonstrates how to connect UI elements to logic and ensure responsive user input. This report outlines the app's purpose, design choices, code structure, and how GitHub and GitHub Actions supported its development.

üéØ The Calculator App's Objective
The main goal of this app is to provide a quick and efficient way for users to calculate two numbers. The application improves the user experience by:

Simplicity: Users only input two numbers and tap a button to get a result.

Efficiency: Button-based operations make math quick and easy.

Scalability: The app structure allows for future additions like percentages, history, or scientific functions.

üé® Design Considerations
üßë‚Äçüíª User Experience and Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Inputs:

EditText field for entering the first number

EditText field for entering the second number

Buttons:

Add +

Subtract -

Multiply √ó

Divide √∑

Output:

A TextView that displays the result.

The design follows a simple, clean, and uncluttered layout for usability.
Users are guided using placeholder hints like ‚ÄúEnter first number‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnter second number.‚Äù

Input Processing:
Retrieves text from input fields.

Converts input to Double.

Checks for empty input before calculation.

Calculation Logic:
A function takes the operation type (+, -, *, /) and uses a when statement to perform math.

Handles divide-by-zero safely.

Modular Design:
UI and calculation logic are kept minimal and separate.

Easy to expand in future versions.

Code Improvements (Optional for Future Versions):
Use a Map to store operations instead of when.

Add a history log for calculations.

Store results using Room or shared preferences.

üîß Possible Improvements:
Add theme options (dark mode).

Add a clear/reset button.

Allow operations on more than 2 numbers.

Add voice input or accessibility features.

üõ†Ô∏è GitHub and YAML
What is YAML?
YAML (YAML Ain‚Äôt Markup Language) is a human-readable format often used for configuration in DevOps tools.
Used in GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

Key Characteristics:
Uses indentation instead of brackets.

Great for storing key-value pairs and lists.

Simple to read and write.

Importance in DevOps:
Defines workflows (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).

Improves reliability of code deployment.

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration using Git.
It allows multiple developers to work on the same project, track changes, and deploy updates safely.

Key GitHub Features:
Version tracking with Git

Pull requests and code reviews

GitHub Actions for automation

Use of GitHub in This App:
Project Storage: Source code stored in a public repo

Version Control: Easy rollback and collaboration

Automation: GitHub Actions can be used for linting, testing, and auto-deployment in future updates

‚úÖ Conclusion
The Simple Calculator App uses a clear structure to perform math operations while demonstrating basic Android development skills.
With help from GitHub for version control and YAML for automation potential, the project is a strong foundation for more advanced Android applications.
